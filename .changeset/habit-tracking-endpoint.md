Implement the `GET /habit/:id` endpoint. Habits are configured in `app.config.json` under a new `habits` array, each with an `id`, `name`, `mode` (`"do-more"` or `"do-less"`), `frontmatterProperty`, and `trackingWindowDays`. The endpoint scans notes for the configured frontmatter property (a numeric value from 1–10) and returns the current rolling-window score, streak, and entry count, plus a point-in-time history for every matching note and all-time highs for score, streak, and tracking-window entries. Scoring sums values from notes within the tracking window (entries from the last 14 days count at a 10x multiplier), then applies a 0.5%-per-day streak bonus and a 0.5%-per-entry bonus (do-more) or penalty (do-less) based on the number of days with entries in the window.
