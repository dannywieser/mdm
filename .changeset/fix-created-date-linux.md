Add configurable created-date resolution for notes: `createdDateProperty` sets the frontmatter key to read (default `"created"`), and `deriveTitleDate` enables extracting the date from the note title using configured `dateFormats`. Notes without a resolved created date return `null` for `createdDate` and are excluded from notes-per-day and trend calculations. A new `notesWithoutCreatedDate` stat counts them. Fixes incorrect notes-per-day chart data on Linux Docker deployments where `stat.birthtime` was unreliable.
