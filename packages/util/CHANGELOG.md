### Minor Changes

- 5b101ab: Notes' frontmatter now always includes an `images` array derived from every image found in the note's raw body text (standard markdown or Obsidian `![[...]]` embeds), so notes no longer need an explicit `cover` frontmatter property. The web app's gallery view reads this array and displays a note's first image as its cover. The `NotesGalleryByMonth` and `NotesGalleryByYear` view components have been removed — use `NotesGallery` instead.

  Removed the `aspectRatio` and `layout` view config fields (from `app.config.json`'s `views`, the `GET /views` response, and the web app's view component props). These had become dead weight: `layout` was never read by any component after an earlier refactor to a CSS masonry grid, and `aspectRatio` only ever sized `NoteCoverGrid`'s pre-load loading skeleton — it did not shape the final rendered card, which sizes itself from the loaded image's natural dimensions. `NoteCoverGrid` now always uses a fixed default skeleton aspect ratio.

  Fixed a bug where a note's external image URL (e.g. `https://...`) in `frontmatter.images` would render as a broken image in the gallery — the web app was always routing it through the local image proxy, which rejects non-local paths. External URLs are now rendered directly, bypassing the proxy. Added a shared `isExternalUrl` helper to `mdm-util` for this check, also adopted by `notes-api`.

  Fixed two smaller edge cases in `frontmatter.images` derivation: a fragment-only image destination (`![alt](#section)`) is no longer surfaced as an image, since it isn't a resolvable image source; and a frontmatter image value with extra whitespace (e.g. from YAML like `" https://... "`) is now trimmed before checking whether it's an external URL, so it no longer gets incorrectly routed through the image proxy.

  Narrowed which external URLs the web app will render directly: only http(s) or protocol-relative URLs bypass the local image proxy now. Any other scheme (`javascript:`, `data:`, `obsidian://`, etc.) renders nothing instead of being passed to `<img src>` unchecked. Added a new `isHttpUrl` helper to `mdm-util` for this.

### Minor Changes

- 2abe52c: Add `GET /stats/history` to stats-service, returning a per-date breakdown of notes created, notes modified, and distinct folders touched across the vault. Adds a `toISODateString` timezone-aware date formatter to `mdm-util`.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- b3996b4: All 5 backend services now handle SIGTERM/SIGINT gracefully: they stop accepting new connections, let in-flight requests finish, disconnect Redis where applicable (`flag-manager`, `image-server`), and force-exit after a 10s timeout if something hangs, instead of being hard-killed mid-request. This is implemented via a new shared `startServer` helper in `mdm-util/node` that also consolidates the near-identical `app.listen(...)` + logging boilerplate that was previously duplicated across all 5 `server.ts` files. `mdm-util`'s Redis client wrapper (`mdm-util/redis`) gains a `disconnect` method used during shutdown.
- a9c4d83: `/health` on every backend service now verifies its actual dependencies instead of always returning a static `{status:"ok"}`: `notes-api`, `habit-tracker`, `stats-service`, and `image-server` check that their vault/images directory is readable, and `flag-manager` pings Redis. Any of these return `503` with an error message on failure. `mdm-util`'s shared Redis client wrapper (`mdm-util/redis`) gains a `ping` method to support this. `notes-api` and `stats-service` also now fail fast and exit at startup if their config can't be resolved, instead of logging the error and continuing to serve requests in a broken state (matching `flag-manager`/`image-server`'s existing behavior).

### Minor Changes

- fb9cd71: Extract vault statistics into a new dedicated `stats-service` app. `GET /stats` has been removed from `notes-api` (a breaking change); the new `stats-service` exposes `GET /stats/meta`, returning total notes, total folders, total words (counted from note bodies, excluding frontmatter), and total attachments grouped by file extension. `mdm-util` gains `countWords` and `countFilesByExtension` (replacing `countFilesRecursive`) to support the new endpoint.
- 498a480: Fix `GET /stats/meta` spiking memory and file-descriptor usage on large vaults (observed causing container restarts with ~4600 notes / 3000 attachments): note bodies are now read with a bounded concurrency (20 at a time via the new `mapWithConcurrency` utility in `mdm-util`) instead of all at once. The response is also cached in memory for 5 minutes, with concurrent requests during a cache miss sharing a single in-flight scan rather than each triggering their own.
