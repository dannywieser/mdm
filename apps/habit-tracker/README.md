# habit-tracker

Express-based API for tracking configurable habits scored from note frontmatter.

## Endpoints

- `GET /health`
  - Purpose: verifies the vault directory (`NOTES_ROOT`) is readable
  - Success response: `200`
    ```json
    { "status": "ok" }
    ```
  - Error response: `503` when config can't be resolved or the vault directory isn't readable
    ```json
    { "status": "error", "error": "ENOENT: no such file or directory, access '/data/notes'" }
    ```
- `GET /habits`
  - Purpose: list every habit configured under `habits` in `app.config.json`, each with its current score, streak, mode, tracking-window entry count, and `targetScore` — intended for rendering a lightweight overview (for example a grid of habit cards) without the per-habit cost of computing full history
  - `targetScore` is omitted from the response (rather than appearing as `null`) for habits where it isn't configured, since `JSON.stringify` drops `undefined` properties
  - `windowEntries` is the count of distinct days with a logged entry within the current `trackingWindowDays` window
  - Success response: `200`
    ```json
    [
      {
        "habitId": "exercise",
        "habitName": "Daily Exercise",
        "habitScore": 525,
        "mode": "do-more",
        "streak": 5,
        "windowEntries": 5
      },
      {
        "habitId": "drinking",
        "habitName": "drinking",
        "habitScore": 38,
        "mode": "do-less",
        "streak": 2,
        "targetScore": 100,
        "windowEntries": 3
      }
    ]
    ```
  - Sample curl command:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost/habits
    ```
- `GET /habits/:id`
  - Purpose: load the habit configured under `habits` in `app.config.json` (matched by `id`), scan notes for the configured `frontmatterProperty` (a numeric value of at least `1`, with no upper bound so habits can track unbounded quantities like a dollar amount), and return the current score, streak, entry count, a point-in-time history for every day from the first matching note through today, a dedicated streak-period breakdown, and all-time highs
  - `mode` and `targetScore` are passed through from the habit's configuration. `targetScore` is only meaningful for `do-less` habits — it defines the score thresholds a UI can use to render a green/yellow/red status (for example a `targetScore` of `100` implies green for scores up to `50`, yellow up to `75`, and red from `75` upward) — and is omitted from the response (rather than appearing as `null`) when not configured, since `JSON.stringify` drops `undefined` properties
  - Scoring: sums frontmatter values from notes within the rolling `trackingWindowDays` window (entries from the last `recentWindowDays` days, default 14, count at a `recentMultiplier`, default 10x) to get a base total, then multiplies it by `(1 + dayMultiplier) * (1 + streakMultiplier)`. Both multipliers use the same *tiered* per-day rate, not a flat one: `baseBonusRate` (default 0.5%) for each of the first `bonusTierSize` (default 5) days/streak-days, +`bonusRateIncrement` (default 0.1%) per additional tier beyond that — so with the defaults, 5 days/streak-days contributes 2.5% (5 × 0.5%), but 10 contributes 5.5% (5 × 0.5% + 5 × 0.6%), not the 5% a flat rate would imply. `dayMultiplier` sums this tiered rate across the distinct days-with-an-entry in the window (always a positive adjustment, in both modes); `streakMultiplier` sums it across the current streak length, applied as a bonus for `do-more` habits and a penalty for `do-less` habits. Final scores are floored to whole numbers. All of these knobs are configurable per-habit via `scoring` (see Configuration below); setting a knob to `0` disables the bonus/penalty it controls, so a habit with every `scoring` field set to `0` simply reports the raw sum of its entry values with no bonuses, penalties, or minimum-streak-length threshold.
  - The top-level `streak` reflects the current streak as of the reference date. Its definition depends on mode:
    - `do-more` habits: the number of consecutive days (ending on the reference date) with an entry — reported as `0` until at least `minStreakDays` (default 2) consecutive days have been logged, since a single logged day hasn't yet spanned a full day-to-day gap and shouldn't read as an established streak. A `minStreakDays` of `0` removes this threshold, so a single logged day is reported as a streak of `1`.
    - `do-less` habits: the number of days since the most recent entry (an entry on today's date resets it to `0`).
  - `streaks` is a dedicated breakdown of historical streak periods, each with `start`, `end`, and `length` (in days):
    - `do-more` habits: periods of consecutive days with a logged entry.
    - `do-less` habits: gaps of consecutive days without a logged entry that fall strictly between two logged entries (the time before the first entry and the ongoing gap since the most recent entry are excluded).
  - `allTimeHighStreak` is the longest `length` across all entries in `streaks`.
  - `lowestDaysTrackedPerPeriod` (`do-less` habits only) is the fewest unique tracked days seen across any complete `trackingWindowDays`-length period, walking backwards from the reference date. A trailing period that starts before the first tracked entry is only partial and is discarded rather than counted as-is, so the field is omitted entirely once there's at least one entry but no complete period has elapsed yet. If the habit has zero logged entries at all, the field is `0` rather than omitted.
  - `trackingWindowDays` echoes back the habit's configured window size, alongside the top-level `mode` and `targetScore` pass-through.
  - The current `habitScore` and each `history` entry's `habitScore` also include a score breakdown:
    - `rawScore`: the sum of entry values in the tracking window with no recency multiplier applied
    - `recentEntryAdditions`: the extra amount contributed by entries within the last `recentWindowDays` days (default 14; each counts at `recentMultiplier`, default 10x, so with the defaults this is `entry.value * 9` summed across those entries)
    - `scoreBeforeMultipliers`: `rawScore + recentEntryAdditions` — the base total before the day/streak adjustments are applied
    - `streakMultiplier` / `dayMultiplier`: the tiered adjustments described above
    - The final `habitScore` is `floor(scoreBeforeMultipliers * (1 + dayMultiplier) * (1 + streakMultiplier))` — the two adjustments are applied as multiplicative factors, not summed
  - The current `habitScore` (but not each `history` entry) additionally includes `scoreBreakdown`, a tier-by-tier accounting of how `dayMultiplier`/`streakMultiplier` were built: `entryScores` (equal to `scoreBeforeMultipliers`), plus `daysTiers` and `streakTiers` — each an array of `{ startDay, endDay, rate, days, amount }` objects, one per `bonusTierSize`-day tier, describing that tier's day range, rate, day count, and dollar-amount contribution to the score. Both arrays are empty when the day/streak bonus is disabled (see `scoring` below), so a UI can hide the bonus breakdown entirely rather than showing zero-amount rows
  - `history` contains one entry for every calendar day from the first matching note through the reference date (inclusive) — not just days with a logged entry — so it can be plotted as a continuous score-over-time graph. Each entry also includes `streak` (the streak as of that day, using the same mode-specific definition as the top-level `streak`) and `value`, the frontmatter value logged that day (`0` on days with no entry; entries on the same date are summed)
  - `scoreEntries` is a per-entry breakdown of the entries contributing to the current `habitScore`, most recent first. Each entry has `date`, `value` (the raw frontmatter value logged that day), `recentMultiplier` — the configured `recentMultiplier` if the entry falls within the last `recentWindowDays` days (and so contributes to `recentEntryAdditions`), or omitted otherwise — and `obsidianUrl`, an `obsidian://` deep link to the note the entry was read from

## Configuration

- `habits` (optional): array of habit configs consumed by `GET /habits` and `GET /habits/:id`. Each habit has:
  - `id`: route key used by `GET /habits/:id`
  - `name`: human-readable label returned in the response
  - `mode`: `"do-more"` or `"do-less"` — controls whether the streak adjustment (`streakMultiplier`) boosts or lowers the score; the days-with-entries adjustment (`dayMultiplier`) is always positive in both modes (see scoring details above)
  - `frontmatterProperty`: frontmatter key holding a numeric value of at least `1` to track (no upper bound, so it can hold an unbounded quantity like a dollar amount)
  - `trackingWindowDays`: size (in days) of the rolling window used to score the habit — must be a positive integer
  - `targetScore` (optional, positive number): only meaningful for `do-less` habits — defines the score thresholds a UI can use to render a green/yellow/red status. A `targetScore` of `100` implies green for scores up to `50` (50% of target), yellow up to `75` (75% of target), and red from `75` upward
  - `scoring` (optional): overrides for the scoring knobs described above. Every field defaults to the value shown and can be set independently; setting a field to `0` disables the bonus/penalty it controls:
    - `recentWindowDays` (default `14`): size of the "recent" window; `0` disables the recency bonus
    - `recentMultiplier` (default `10`): multiplier applied to entries within the recent window; `0` disables the recency bonus
    - `bonusTierSize` (default `5`): number of days per tier for the day/streak bonus; `0` disables the day/streak bonus entirely
    - `baseBonusRate` (default `0.005`): per-day rate for the first tier; `0` (combined with `bonusRateIncrement: 0`) disables the day/streak bonus entirely
    - `bonusRateIncrement` (default `0.001`): additional per-day rate added for each tier beyond the first
    - `minStreakDays` (default `2`): minimum consecutive days (`do-more` habits only) before a streak is reported as non-zero; `0` removes this threshold
    - Setting every `scoring` field to `0` turns off all bonuses, penalties, and the minimum streak threshold, so the habit simply reports the raw sum of its entry values, its streak, and its calendar of entries — useful for a habit you just want to track without any score calculation
